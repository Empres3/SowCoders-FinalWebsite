 <h1 class="title">GLOBAL WARMING</h1> 

  <br>
  
  <h3> What is Global Warming?</h3>
  
  <p class="meaning"> Global Warming is a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, CFCs, and other pollutants.</p>

  <p> The Greenhouse Effect is the process by which heat is trapped in the lower atmosphere of the Earth by greenhouse gases.</p>
  
<p> These gases absorb infared radiation heating up, causing the atmosphere to be warmer.</p>

<p> The process is called the greenhouse effect because the exchange of incoming and outgoing radiation that warms the planet works in a similar way to a greenhouse. Picture this: a greenhouse is so successful at growing plants year-round, even when it's too cold outside for some plants to typically thrive.</p>

  <a id="2"><h3> Causes of Global Warming</h3></a>
  
  
  <b><p> Some of the gases that cause Global Warming are-</p></b>
  
  <ul>
    <li> Carbon Dioxide from fossil fuels</li>
    <li> Deforestation</li>
    <li> Methane</li>
    <li> Nitrogen Oxide</li>
    <li> Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li>
  </ul>
<p> When these gases are trapped in the atmosphere of the Earth. The heat held in these gases from being trapped cause the changes known on Earth as <strong>Climate Change</strong></p>

</center>
  
   <b><p> Some of these include-</p></b>
  
  <ul>
    <li> Changes in weather patterns such as more frequent and intense droughts, flooding, storms, increased heat etc.</li>
    <li> Changes in agricultural yields- Because weather patterns change in different countries the crops grown there would not be accustomed to these new climates and not much crop would be produced.</li>
    <li> Human Health and Comfort- Heat Stress, the different climates that different parts of the world have are now changing and those who arent accustomed to heat now get lots of it which can make everyday life very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Increases in numbers of disease-carrying insects and tropical diseases- The new temperatures caused by <b>Global Warming</b> cause different insects to be able to travel to new places spreading diseases.</li>
    <li> Melting of permafrost in artic zones- permafrost is ground that remains completely frozen for at least two years. The heat recently has been causing those to melt.</li>
    <li> Urban Air Pollution- The air that is in and around cities is affected by transportation, domestic use of fossil fuels, industrialization, beauty products(hair sprays) </li>
   
  </ul>

  <a id="4"><h3> Solutions of Global Warming</h3></a>

 <b> <p> There are many measures that can be taken to reduce the rate of Global Warming</p></b>
  
  <ul class="square">
   <li><strong>Reducing the use of fossil fuels by introducing renweable energy</strong></li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="list"> 
    <b><li> Tidal Power being harnessed a built barrage using generator turbines to create energy when the tide flows. </li>
    <li> Solar Power generated by the use of solar panels turning heat into energy for homes and other commercial uses.
</li>
    <li> Wind Power harnessed by building wind turbines that turn wind into energy when the blades are turned. </li>
    <li> And Hydroeletric Power which is done by damming a river to create energy.</li></b>
  </ul>

  <ul class="square">
   <li><strong> Reducing the emission of carbon dioxide</strong</li>
  </ul>

  
  <ul class="list"> 
   <li> Reforestation- this can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and thus give some help to neutralizing carbon emmisions.</li>
    <li> Sustainability of Forestry- When forests are cut they should be replanted to ensure the continuity of timber supply and a means of absorbing carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li> And Green Spaces- the heat formed by industrial and domestic activites can cause heat islands to be created. Planting green spaces in cities (such as woodland or forests and parks) can reduce this effect.</li>
  </ul>
